client sends request, server sends response. this is great in TRADITIONAL web apps.

what if we don't want HTML?

client => stores and fetches data, but doesn't want html, just wants data.
client => can be code, want to access data
client => SPA. we have a web app, we only need HTML for the first request, just data after that.

difference between REST api and

they are stateless backends -- they do not care about whic client connected
can be XML, JSON, URLencoded, formData
