  REST API in Node.js
</h1>

**About:**

This is practice for a test. Apparently it's in backend, which I have no experience in. Let's go, baby.

**Back-end:**
There are two endpoints, /products and /orders, that return JSON responses.

**Things I learnt:**

- How to spin up a server in vanilla node.JS
- How incredibly tedious it was
- How to use express
- setting up basic REST API routes and methods with expess
- error handling...yikes

[Node.js:](https://nodejs.org/en/) Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

[Postman:](https://www.postman.com/) "The Collaboration Platform for API Development."
